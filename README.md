# cvd_sql
cvd sql database builder as well as other cvd sql utils


This code is a Python script designed to automate the process of extracting data from Excel files and importing it into a SQL Server database. It uses several libraries: openpyxl for reading Excel files, pyodbc for database connectivity, and standard libraries like json, os, and shutil for configuration and file management.

The script starts by defining a utility function, read_excel, which loads an Excel workbook and returns a list of worksheet objects, skipping temporary files (those with ~$ in their name). This function is used to gather data from all Excel files in a specified directory.

The core logic is encapsulated in the sql_data_handler class. When instantiated, this class reads configuration details (such as database connection parameters) from a JSON file, and stores the Excel data and file paths. The class provides several methods for processing Excel data: it can generate complex column names based on cell ranges and headers, build SQL queries for creating tables, and manage the addition of columns to those tables. The methods section_to_cols, gen_col_names, and complex_addy work together to extract and format column names from structured regions of the Excel sheets, handling special cases like comments and special characters.

The build_table method creates a new SQL table for each Excel sheet, using specific cell values to generate the table name and column names. If the table does not already exist, it is created with a basic set of columns. The build_cols method then adds additional columns to the table, based on the dynamically generated column names from the Excel data. The build_db method orchestrates the process for all loaded Excel files, iterating through each sheet, generating columns, creating tables, and moving processed files to a "processed" directory.

Database connections are managed with the connect and close methods, which open and close the connection using the parameters loaded from the configuration file. The scriptâ€™s entry point (if __name__ == "__main__":) walks through the "to_process" directory, reads all Excel files, initializes the sql_data_handler, connects to the database, processes the files, and then closes the connection.

Overall, this script provides a flexible and automated way to import structured data from Excel files into a SQL Server database, with configurable connection settings and robust handling of complex Excel layouts.
